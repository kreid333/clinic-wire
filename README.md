## Installation

To use this application, run 'npm install' to install all of the packages listed as dependencies for both the server and React.

## Usage 

The user must run 'npm start' in order to start both the express server and React simultaneously. After opening their local host in browser, they can then sign up or login; which, once completed, will take the user to the dashboard, where the main functionality of the application can be accessed.

Instead of running locally, the application can also be ran here:
